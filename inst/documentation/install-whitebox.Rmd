## Installation of WhiteboxTools Binary

We want to have *WhiteboxTools* installed during the Github Actions Workflow
using `whitebox::install_whitebox()`.

As mentioned in this 
[whiteboxR issue](https://github.com/giswqs/whiteboxR/issues/76),
it happens from time to time, that the download of the *WhiteboxTools zip file* 
from https://www.whiteboxgeo.com fails.

## Docker images

Let's have a look at the most recently built docker images.

First download the docker images from dockerhub.
```{bash docker_pull}

tags=("4.1.2" "4.1.3" "4.2.0")

# pull docker images
for t in "${tags[@]}"
do
    img="meterds/r-aws-spatial:$t"
    # echo $img
    docker pull $img -q
done

# list of docker images
docker image ls

```

And then check if the *whitebox binary* can be found.
```{bash docker_runÂ´}
tags=("4.1.2" "4.1.3" "4.2.0")

# walk through images and check whether whiteboxtools is installed
for t in "${tags[@]}"
do
    img="meterds/r-aws-spatial:$t"
    echo $img
    docker run --rm $img Rscript -e "whitebox::check_whitebox_binary()"
done

```
